Throwing Exceptions 
if there exists exceptions, we can write our own exception warning:
throw new IllegalArgumentException("")
throw new RuntimeException("")

Try and catch Exceptions
Advantage:
after the exception, java will print the exception and keep going, the most important thing is that we can do something in catch to fix the error

Checked Exceptions
the excetions you must handle before compile, you cannot run
eg: IOException
However if you use catch, java will allow you, and you should handle this problem in catch
You can also use specify, and someone else should handle it  -- write "throw IOException" after the method head

Question:
Why we need to use try and catch instead of using if statement to fix the exception?
