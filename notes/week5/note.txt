Environment variables
CLASSPATH = :/home/jug/course-materials-sp16/javalib/*:./

With classpath above, java and javac check for dependencies in:
	/home/jug/course-materials-sp16/javalib/*
	* means don't just look at class files but also look inside any .jar file
	./ --> means current directory
	../ --> means directory one up


***************************************************************************
Package
make a package can allow you to import your own package to other class(like library)

To compile a class in a package, if you don't want to compile it under the correct directory, you can use "javac -d ..."


***************************************************************************
For each primitive type, there is a corresponding reference type.
eg: boolean's wrapper class is Boolean

Autoboxing
Defn: Implicit conversions between wrapper/primitives.
If you hava a parameter type "Integer", java will automatically create "int" for you 
 

***************************************************************************
Immutability
Immutable data type
An immutable data type is one for which an instance cannot change in any observable way after instantiation.
eg: integer, string
public final int x;
"final" keyword will help the compiler ensure immutability
once you declare the value of x you cannot instantiate again in order to change it
However if it is reference type, you can change the value but not the run-time type
