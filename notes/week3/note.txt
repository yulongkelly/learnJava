Test-Driven Development(TDD)
1. identify a new feature
2. write a test for that feature
3. run the test. It should fail(since, you write the test before writing the code)
4. Write code that pass the test
optional: refactor code to make it faster, cleaner, ect.

Hypernym and Hyponym
dog: Hyoernym(统称)of "poodle", "malamute"...
poodle : hyponym of "dog"

Overloading
multiple methods with the same name


Override
if a subclass has a method with the same signiture as superclass(interface class; hypernym), we say the subclass method overrides the method.

Interface Inheritance:
Use one calss(hypernym) to represent other subclasses

note: we can write a defult method in interface class, which every subclasses can use it. Even if there is a defult method(print) in superclass, the subclass can still override a new method with the same name(print).(since you may not trust the defult method).


Question:
if you run this code:
public staic void main(string[] args) {
	List61B<String> someList = new SList<String>();
	someList.print();
}
Which print method will run?
A: the defult method in List61B
B: the override method in SList
note: List61B is the super class

the answer is B.
why?
Every variable in Java has two types:
static Type: declaration
dynamic type: instantiation(when using new)
if dynamic type overrides the method, it is used instead
